With mpv, search for the target image. When you find it, Ctrl + O will display the current frame (use https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/3428). Lets say its
the frame N=120

With cutframe.sh, cut the desired frame as plain decoded YUV (./cutframe.sh test.mkv 120 out.yuv).

Then, framepos will tell you that the image out.yuv is located in frame 120 (./framepos test.mkv out.yuv)

You can check it with:

ffmpeg -i test.mkv -vf "select=eq(n\,119)" -vframes 1 out.png

You can see that out.png is the same as the frame 120 in the input video
